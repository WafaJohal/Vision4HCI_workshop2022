# Introduction

In this session, you will learn how to use machine vision to make new controls for a game.
This worksheet will guide you through the different steps to make a basic hand gesture controller. But you are free to spice up things and explore other types of interactions.

## Objectives

- To understand the concept of particle systems and implement it
- To integrate a gesture/object recognition system into a game as a controller

## Preliminary steps

To complete this workshop, you will need a computer with a webcam. You will also need to know Python and have installed mediapipe as well as pygame. 

We recommend you to setup a virtual environment for this: 

```sh
python3 -m venv mp_env && source mp_env/bin/activate
```

You can then install mediapipe

```sh
pip install mediapipe
pip install pygame
```

```{tableofcontents}
